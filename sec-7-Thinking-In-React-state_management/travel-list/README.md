# travel list project

In our travel list project, each "Item" is something to pack, and "Quantity" tells you how much of it. Check the "Packing Status" to see if it's packed ("Packed/Unpacked"). You can organize your list by the order you add items or alphabetically with "Sort Order." "Category" groups items like clothes or toiletries, and "Priority" helps you set importance levels. Here's a quick overview in bullet points:

- Item: Something to pack for the trip.
- Quantity: Indicates the amount of each item.
- Packing Status: Shows if an item is packed or not.
- Packed/Unpacked: Binary indicator of inclusion in the luggage.
- Sort Order: Organizes the list by input order or alphabetically or by packed status.
