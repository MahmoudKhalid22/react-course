# Redux and Redux toolkit section

## lesson 1

let's get into one topic of the big course (redux).
For many peoples redux is big and kind of scary thing that find impossible to learn.
For you however it's the opposite because you already know useReducer hook works and therefore learning redux is actually going to be quite straightforward and a lot of fun.

so to make it really easy we're gonna start at the very fundamentals by learning redux in isolation and then use it in small application and convert it to more modern redux toolkit and we even gonna make api requests right inside redux using thunks.

## lesson 2

as always, let's start by getting a good understanding of what Redux actually is and how the mechanics of redux work especially when compared with the userReducer hook.

in fact, many developers even say that the context api is the replacement for Redux.
However, the truth is a bit more nuanced than that as we will discuss by the end of the section once you have some experience with both of these tools.

## Questions

#### q) the difference between redux and useContext

Redux Pros for Many UI Global States:

Centralized Store: Redux keeps all your global state in one place, making it easier to track and reason about how your application changes.
Predictable Updates: Updates to the state are handled through pure reducer functions, ensuring predictable and consistent behavior.
Testability: Redux's architecture promotes writing isolated and testable state logic.
Scalability: Redux scales well for complex applications with numerous interdependent state changes.
Redux Cons to Consider:

Complexity: Setting up and learning Redux has a steeper learning curve compared to built-in React hooks.
Boilerplate: Redux requires more boilerplate code for actions, reducers, and store setup.
Overkill for Simple Apps: For smaller applications with limited global state, Redux might be an unnecessary overhead.
Alternatives to Redux for Simpler Scenarios:

useContext: As you mentioned, useContext can be a lightweight and effective way to share state across a few components.
React State Management Libraries: Libraries like Zustand or MobX offer simpler APIs compared to Redux while still providing features for global state management.
So, When is Redux Ideal?

Redux shines in these scenarios:

Large applications with extensive global state: When your app has numerous interconnected UI state pieces that need to be shared and updated across various components.
Complex state updates: If your state updates involve complex logic or dependencies between different parts of the state.
Need for advanced features: When you require features like middleware for asynchronous operations, time-travel debugging, or complex state normalization techniques.
